# 1) Attached you will find a CSV titled “NBA_Names”. This contains the first and last names of certain historical NBA players. Your objective is to find the longest “name chain” possible (e.g. “Kobe Bryant Reeves,” combining Kobe Bryant and Bryant Reeves). Use each player’s name only once.
a. What is your methodology? What is the longest name chain you can find?
b. What if you remove suffixes such as “Jr.”? How many distinct suffixes can you find?
c. What if you treat every hyphenated last name as both possibilities (e.g. “Shai Gilgeous-
Alexander” becomes “Shai Gilgeous” and “Shai Alexander” as separate people)?
d. Finally, what if names are reversible (e.g. “Kobe Bryant” can also be treated as “Bryant Kobe”)?

# 2) Within the CSV, you’ll also find “Draft Year” and “Years of Service” columns. Below, consider only those with nonzero “Draft Year” values.
a. What is the fewest number of players whose careers span 1955 to 2020?
b. What is the longest name chain whose careers overlap with each others’? (e.g. “LeBron James”
and “James Edwards” would not qualify since they did not play at the same time)
